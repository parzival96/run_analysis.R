1. Data is downloaded and then extracted in the folder of "UCI HAR Dataset".
2. The data is assigned to appropriate variables such as :
features to features.txt - which is the data from accelerometer and gyrosccope.
activities to activity_labels.txt - Activities concerning to which measurements are taken.

Variables dealing with the test data :-

subject_test to subject_test.txt - test data of 30% of the subjects which is 9 out of 30
x_test to X_test.txt - contains recorded featured data
y_test to Y_test.txt - consists of test data

Variable dealing with the training data :-

subject_train to subject_train.txt - training data of 70% of subject i.e 21 out of 300
x_test to x_test.txt - contains recorded features data
y_test to y_test.txt - contains the training data of activities' labels.

Merging the dataset

X formed by rowbinding x_train and x_test 
Y formed by rowbinding y_train and y_test
Subject formed by rowbinding subject_train and subject_test
Merged_Data formed by Subject,X,Y using cbind()

TidyData created by extracting only subject and measurements of mean and sd() on each measurement

The numbers in the code column of TidyData is replaced by the corresponding activity 

The dataset is labelled appropriately with descriptive variable names.

At last, FinalData is created by summarizing TidyData taking means of each variable for each activity
and each subject
